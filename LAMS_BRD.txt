Land Acquisition Management System (LAMS)
Business Requirements Document (BRD)
– Single-Service, Top-Class Edition –Version: 1.0 • Date: November 11, 2025 • Owner: Project Steering Committee1. Executive SummaryThis BRD defines a single-service, full-stack web application to digitize the end-to-end Land Acquisition lifecycle—from Social Impact Assessment (SIA) through preliminary and final notifications (Sections 11 & 19), objections and hearings, compensation and Letters of Intent (LOIs)/Awards, to possession and post-possession updates. It consolidates prior requirements and augments them with best-in-class features to deliver transparency, speed, and compliance.2. Vision & GoalsCitizen-first, paperless-by-default, audit-ready acquisition process.Configurable yet simple single-application deployment (no microservices).High trust: verifiable documents (QR + hash), robust audit trails, and role-based controls.Geo-enabled decisions: parcels and notifications are mapped and validated against GIS layers.Actionable insights: built-in analytics, SLA compliance, and anomaly detection.3. Scope & Out of ScopeIn ScopeSIA publication, feedback intake, hearing scheduling and reporting.Section 11 (preliminary) and Section 19 (final) notification drafting, approval, publishing.Objection intake, hearing, resolution, and order issuance.Compensation calculation (cash/land-pooling/hybrid), LOI and Award generation, payment tracking.Possession scheduling, field evidence capture (geo-tagged), and certificate issuance.GIS parcel linkage and validation, DMS-backed document generation and storage.Notifications (Email/SMS/WhatsApp), dashboards, and comprehensive reporting.User administration, roles & permissions, templates, and configuration panels.Out of Scope (for this release)Blockchain notarization (kept as a future-ready hook).Advanced external ERP/HRMS modules (beyond basic integrations described).Auto-cad rule-checking for building plans (handled by separate modules).4. Stakeholders & RolesAdministrator: configuration, user/role management, templates.Case Officer (Land Acquisition Officer - LAO): manages SIA, notices, objections, awards, possession.Legal Officer: legal review/approval, orders.Finance Officer: compensation review, payments, reconciliation.Citizen/Landowner: feedback, objections, acknowledgments, downloads, status tracking.Auditor/Oversight: read-only access to audit logs, reports, and documents.5. Principles & Non‑NegotiablesSingle deployable service (monolith) with modular layers (UI, services, data).Security by default: strong auth, least privilege, audit on every state change, PII minimization.Reliability: daily backups, RTO ≤ 2h, RPO ≤ 15m; graceful degradation.Accessibility: WCAG-aligned screens; mobile-friendly officer workflows.Internationalization: English baseline with stubs for Punjabi/Hindi labels.6. User Journeys (Key Flows)SIA: Publish notice → Collect feedback → Schedule/record hearing → Generate SIA report.Notifications: Draft Sec-11 → Legal approve → Publish → Objection window → Resolve/Order → Publish Sec-19.Compensation & LOIs/Awards: Intake parcel/owner data → Valuation calculator → LOI/Award PDFs → Payments & receipts.Possession: Schedule → Capture geo-tagged evidence → Issue possession certificate → Update parcel status.7.
